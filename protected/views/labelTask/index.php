<h1>Label Tasks</h1>
Label tasks are the collaborative jobs that users participate in to respond to a label for an image set. Label tasks can be defined, managed, and updated in this module.
They are defined by specifying an image set and a label to set what question you would like answered by the community for some collection of images.
